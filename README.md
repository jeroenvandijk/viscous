## Dependency

```clojure
com.phronemophobic/viscous {:git/sha "5d07ec56d39c38beecbf2f5da0ff0d99980acfc7"
                            :git/url "https://github.com/phronmophobic/viscous"}
```

## Usage

(require '[com.phronemophobic.viscous :as viscous])


(def my-data {:a {:b 42}})

;; open inspector window
(viscous/inspect my-data)

```

## Status

Viscous is still pretty alpha. Behavior is subject to change. Feedback is welcome.

## Related

I'm generally interested in finding better ways to represent and explore medium sized heterogenous data. If you like viscous, you may also be interested in [treemap-clj](https://github.com/phronmophobic/treemap-clj).
